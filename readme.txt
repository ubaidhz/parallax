I have recreated the Nike parallax effect originally authored by Ian Lunn for one of my curricular projects. Happy with the effects I have achieved. 
Code is currently using newposition method to calculate the rendering viewport which leaves a margin of 100px at smaller viewports. 
Ping me if you have any issues.
